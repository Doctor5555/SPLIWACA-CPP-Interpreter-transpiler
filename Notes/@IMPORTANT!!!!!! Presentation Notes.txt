Presentations:

A good presentation adds to the marks. A bad presentation does not drop marks.

Presentation Record Part A must be completed before the presentation.
Presentations will be the week beginning 16th March. Groups of no more than 5 students and the supervisor.
Presentations will be 12-15 minutes. Therefore presentation should be 7-10 minutes, to allow a bit of time for questions, set up and packing away.
A projector may not be available so either have the presentation set up on paper or on a laptop.
Check materials before the presentation.
Th presentation is a way to compensate for any points in the rest of the project which are not as good as they might be.
Most of the presentation should be about answering the question, with perhaps some about a review, but it can include any section.
Cue cards are good to keep track of where you are.
Bring the artefact in.
Poster as visual aid - doesn't have to be perfect, could be just images as visual stimulus, or perhaps diagrams, but it can include words.
Going too long or too short will reflect badly. Meant to be planned for a 10-minute presentation.
